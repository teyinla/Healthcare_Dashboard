# Healthcare_Dashboard
Explore diverse health data! This repository contains patient infoâ€”demographics, satisfaction, wait times, and referrals. Analyze with Power BI for deep insights into healthcare trends, patient satisfaction, and department dynamics. Unveil patterns that enhance our understanding of the healthcare system.

This analysis leveraged Power BI for end-to-end data processing. I conducted data cleaning as I seamlessly performed ETL, model building, and visualization in Power BI. I implemented DAX functions to create columns, measures, tables, and virtual tables. Utilized conditional formatting for enhanced insights. Key questions addressed include:
